# Problems
- Fix URL title in confirmation page
- Email confirmation is slow
- Reset password button has blue text instead of white
- Reset password need to add 'Wait a few minutes or check spam' just like registration
- Login crashes if invalid password
- Schedule is default schedule if you logout and log back in or something
- When add a class and directly try to add an alias, it says "**Error adding alias** Invalid class id!" until you refresh the page
- Changes don't take effect after the class has been created
- Some checkboxes aren't disabled for the aliases even though they should
