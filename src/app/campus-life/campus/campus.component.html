				MICDS' Upper School newspaper, <i>The Voice</i>, expresses the diverse interests of
				our community. Through mediums such as writing, drawing, photographing, and even
				more, <i>The Voice</i> provides individuals with an outlet to connect with the
				community, while allowing the community to learn more about the individual. No
				matter the form in which you would like to express yourself, <i>The Voice</i> wants
				you to share as the MICDS community needs your ideas and insights! Please contact
				bsneider@micds.org if you ever want to share something with the community, or if you
